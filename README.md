# HackTheBox Writeups

This repo contains solutions, explanations, and scripts for various HTB challenges across different categories, including cryptography, reverse engineering, web exploitation, and more.

## Cryptography Challenges

For cryptographic challenges, I use a modified version of [crypto-attacks](https://github.com/jvdsn/crypto-attacks/). If you come across an import statement like:

```
from crypto_attacks.blablablaa import blabla
```

It means the code is sourced from that repository. However, some of my own modifications and additional implementations are not included, as I wrote them myself. I am currently working on publishing them separately.

Additionally, the module `crypto_attacks.shared.small_roots.coppersmith` used in some of my scripts refers to the implementation available at [defund/coppersmith](https://github.com/defund/coppersmith).
